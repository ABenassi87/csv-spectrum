# csv-spectrum

A bunch of different CSV files to serve as an acid test for CSV parsing libraries. There are also JSON versions of the CSVs for verification purposes.

The goal of this repository is to capture test cases to represent the entire CSV spectrum. 

Please use these in your test suites and send contributions in the form of more/improved test cases.

Some CSVs here were included from [csvkit](https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit/tree/master/examples)
